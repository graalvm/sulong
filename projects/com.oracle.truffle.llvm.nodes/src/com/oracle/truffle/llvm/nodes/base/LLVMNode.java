/**
 * A {@link LLVMNode} is the super class of all LLVM nodes. Nodes that directly inherit from it are
 * usually instructions in the LLVM IR. Nodes that produce a result should inherit from
 * {@link LLVMExpressionNode}. <br />
 * <br />
 * For example, in <code>result = add i32 4, var</code> the whole instruction corresponds to the
 * notion of a statement since its result is not returned to the enclosing block and thus inherits
 * from {@link LLVMNode}. Since the addition produces a result further used for assignment, it
 * inherits from {@link LLVMExpressionNode}.
