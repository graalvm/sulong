     * Global variables can be either declared in the managed source code, or they can be external.
     * We determine this lazily, as we don't know if a global variable will be declared in managed
     * code or not until we have loaded all the managed code. Therefore global variables all start
     * in an UNKNOWN state.
     *
     * If a declaration is seen in managed code, the global variable moves to the DECLARED state.
     *
     * A global variable declared in managed code can either store managed or native values. Code
     * will often assign a native value as part of initialization, before wanting to use managed
     * values, so an initial write of a native value puts the global variable into the
     * INITIAL_NATIVE state. A global variable in either the DECLARED or INITIAL_NATIVE state can
     * then store a native or managed value, and on the first store it will transition to the NATIVE
     * or MANAGED state, and will stay in that state permanently.
     *
     * Reading a global variable in the DECLARED state is an error. Writing a managed value to a
     * global variable in the NATIVE state is an error.
     *
     * If a declaration is never seen, it transitions to the NATIVE state the first time it is read
     * or written, and the address is looked up in the native symbol table.
     *
     * The state of global variables is permanently fixed the first time they read or the first time
     * they are written with a managed value. They are permanently fixed the second time that they
     * written with a native value, due to our handling of initialization writes of native values
     * which may be followed by an actual write with a managed value or another native value.
