## General

### How can I get started understanding Sulong?

A good starting point is to read and look through the
[papers and presentations about Sulong](PUBLICATIONS.md).
The paper [Sulong - Execution of LLVM-Based Languages on the JVM](http://2016.ecoop.org/event/icooolps-2016-sulong-execution-of-llvm-based-languages-on-the-jvm)
provides a minimal description of Sulong and describes its main goals.

To understand more about Truffle, on which Sulong is implemented, is to
read the papers [Self-optimizing AST interpreters](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2384587)
and [One VM to rule them all](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2509581).
A heavily documented Truffle language sample implementation is
[SimpleLanguage](https://github.com/graalvm/simplelanguage).
To understand how Sulong calls native functions you can read the paper
[An efficient native function interface for Java](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2500832).

To start working with the code you can try to tackle one of the
[open issues](https://github.com/graalvm/sulong/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abeginner+).
Do not hesitate to ask questions!

## Mx

### How does mx execute a specific command?

To get a command line command you can use the `-v` mx option. For
example, `mx -v su-tests` prints the command line when executing the
Sulong test cases.

### What can I do when Java files got corrupted?

You can clean your workspace with `mx clean`. If you only want to clean
Java or native projects you can use `mx clean` with the options
`--no-native` or `--no-java`.

### How can I debug a failing test case?

To attach a debugger to Sulong tests, run `mx -d su-suite sulong`.
To get a verbose output of all tests that run as part of a suite, run
`mx -v su-suite sulong`. This also prints names for all individual tests.
You can use the test names to run a single test of a suite.
For example, `test[c/max-unsigned-short-to-float-cast.c]` is part of the
SulongSuite. You can run this single test using
`mx unittest SulongSuite#test[c/max-unsigned-short-to-float-cast.c]`

## Eclipse

### How can I use Sulong with Eclipse?

In order to work with Eclipse, use `mx eclipseinit` to generate the
Eclipse project files. Import not only the Sulong project, but also the
Truffle project from `sulong-dev/graal/truffle`. You have the choice to
either use remote debugging and launch Sulong in mx, or launch Sulong
within Eclipse.

If you use Eclipse to launch Sulong, you have to ensure that all needed
packages are on the classpath and all necessary options set. You can
determine them by using `-v` in the mx Sulong command to make mx
output information on how it executed the command.

### How can I debug Sulong with Eclipse?

To debug the execution of a bitcode file in Eclipse, first start an mx
command with the `-d` flag, e.g.:

    $ mx -d su-run test.ll
    Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 8000

In Eclipse, set a breakpoint, navigate to
`Run->Debug->Remote Java Application` and select one
of the debug configurations, e.g.,`truffle-attach-localhost-8000`.
After clicking `Debug`, execution starts and the program should stop at
the specified breakpoint.

## Errors

### `UnsatisfiedLinkError` in `HotSpotNativeFunctionInterface`

With new installations of Sulong it can happen, that a shared
library needed by the test cases (or other parts of Sulong) cannot be found.

For example, the following error could appear:

    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError:
    /usr/lib/libxml2.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
        at com.oracle.graal.truffle.hotspot.nfi.HotSpotNativeFunctionInterface.getLibraryHandle(HotSpotNativeFunctionInterface.java:68)
        at com.oracle.graal.truffle.hotspot.nfi.HotSpotNativeFunctionInterface.getLibraryHandle(HotSpotNativeFunctionInterface.java:1)
        at com.oracle.truffle.llvm.nativeint.NativeLookup.getNativeFunctionHandles(NativeLookup.java:99)
        at com.oracle.truffle.llvm.nativeint.NativeLookup.getLibraryHandles(NativeLookup.java:84)
        at com.oracle.truffle.llvm.nativeint.NativeLookup.lookupSymbol(NativeLookup.java:120)
        at com.oracle.truffle.llvm.nativeint.NativeLookup.getNativeHandle(NativeLookup.java:153)

In case of an `UnsatisfiedLinkError`, first check whether the external
dependencies are installed. You can check the package names of the
external dependencies for Ubuntu in the `.travis.yml` file.
There you can find the command `sudo apt-get install -y libxml2-dev`
to install the library on Ubuntu. For other distributions, you usually
can find packages with the same content under a similar name.

If installing the library does not solve the problem, then probably
because the shared library is expected to be at a certain location,
such as in `/usr/lib` in the example above.
In such a case, first identify the location of the library (e.g.,
`locate libxml2.so`) and then explicitly specify location and name
of the library using the `-Dpolyglot.llvm.libraryPath` and
`-Dpolyglot.llvm.libraries` options. Alternatively you can create a
link to the library in the expected location
(e.g., `ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxml2.so /usr/lib/libxml2.so`).
